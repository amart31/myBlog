        <p>Welcome to my little corner of the internet.</p>
        <p>
          I am a Pega CSSA and work as Pega Architect. I have decided to begin blogging in my spare time as a way of honing my skills and practice my writing while at it. I figured maybe I can be of help to someone out there going through the same issues as me. 
        </p>
        <p>
        I intend to write about Pega, Front-End technologies such as React and Gatsby, and also anything I might find interesting at the moment. Be warned, my personal interest vary like the wind. Bare with me as I try to be more consistent with my publishing, also I might come back and update posts periodically if needed. 
        </p>

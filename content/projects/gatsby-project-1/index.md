description: "Gatsby landing page and blog. Reacturing pages and components to shy away from class components and rely more on hooks. Landing page will include an about me, projects section, and contact form. Blogging mainly about Pega, low-code-no-code solutions, robotics process automation, and Front-End technologies such as Gatsby, React, and vanilla Js, and accessiblity both in Pega and front-ends."

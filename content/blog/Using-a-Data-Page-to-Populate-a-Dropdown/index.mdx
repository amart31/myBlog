import Button from "src/components/button"

## Scenario

This blogpost is coming soon. For now enjoy a JSX custom component in MDX. 

## Custom components

You can also import custom React components locally. Make sure [gatsby-plugin-root-import](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/plugins/gatsby-plugin-root-import/) as relative paths will not work.

```jsx
// Import custom component
import Button from "src/components/button"
```

```jsx
<Button>Test</Button>
```

<Button>Test</Button>

Coming Soon. Coming Soon.
